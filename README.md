# DT2119Project
Final project for the course Speech and Speaker Recognition at KTH 2018.

In this project we evaluated the effect of combining Dense, Convolutional and Recurrent layers in a single network for Phoneme classification.

We developed a network very similar to the one described in this [paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/fr//pubs/archive/43455.pdf).

Our paper can be found [here](https://github.com/eysteinn13/DT2119Project/blob/master/report.pdf).
